      "DC Crimebusters set out to help users make knowledgeable decisions about their personal safety when taking Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) trains to their destinations. Riders have developed perceptions about Metro stops within the District based on anecdotal evidence and this analysis aims to support or disprove riders\u2019 notions. The final product will be a mobile application in which users may enter their destination in Washington, DC and the time of travel, and our app will inform them of the relative safety of the destination neighborhood at that time. It will inform them which crimes to be most aware of and recommend taking a taxi or private car hire if the probability of being victimized exceeds a specified threshold."
